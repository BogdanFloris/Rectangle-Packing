## IMPORTANT
Before committing for the first time, add a file named .gitignore and copy the contents from "gitignore" in that file. Each person should be able to use his/her own preferred editor to write the algorithm. There should not be any IDE-specific files on this branch.

The implementation of the algorithm will only be done on this branch; if you want to try out your own algorithms and still use version control then make your own branch - you can merge everything with master later.

Only push changes if you actually changed something and we all agreed upon it.
