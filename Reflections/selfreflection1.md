# Self-Reflection 1
##### _by Bogdan Floris 0935036_

Having made some group projects during my time in the university, I have a general idea about what my skills and my weaknesses are when working in a team on a project. I want to take this DBL as a huge opportunity not only to further reinforce my strengths, but most importantly to overcome my weaknesses.

What I love about Computer Science is the thrill of tackling a hard problem and overcoming any difficulties that arise when solving that problem. This brings me to my first strength, which is problem solving. This I think is the most important skill I will bring to my team. Moreover, solving a problem _on paper_ is important and a big and important step but it doesn't matter if you cannot put that solution in practice, which in our case is done via programming, which I think I am good at and it will be an asset in this project.

Before even attempting to tackle a problem, one needs to understand in depth what the problem is about. This is done via finding information already available on the subject matter and understanding it really well. Research is one of my favorite things to do because I love learning about new things and I will be doing it with pleasure for this project as well.

Actually solving the problem and having a good and efficient algorithm for it is important of course but even if we have very good programmers in the group, we won't achieve this goal if we are not well organized and the workload is not distributed evenly. The problem must be tackled step by step and in a structured manner and everyone's tasks should be clear and concise. I believe myself to be a really organized person and I will do my best to project that upon our team in order to make our work more efficient and better overall.

These are the skills that I believe will be of benefit to our team but I also believe that there is always room for improvement so I also know that I will learn new things about these skills.

After a quick first impression on our team, I believe that our group quite is well balanced and I am quite pleased about that because we need a lot of skills for this project to be completed successfully. We have people that are good with problem solving, with programming, with writing, etc. It may be the case in the future that writing will become a lot of work compared to the actual programming and if that becomes the case, then I will want to take advantage of the oppurtunity to learn more about writing. But all in all, I have a good feeling that the group will perform well on all sides of this project.

This assignment is first and foremost about learning, so staying in my confort zone and just working on the problem and programming would be a bad decision for me. This is the best chance for me to improve on two skills that I feel I am not so good at. First, writing and presenting: I can write decently and of course I want to learn more about that but more importantly I want to learn how to give a good presentation because I have never been good at that, so I will put a lot of effort when the time comes in order to give a good presentation.

Furthermore, I have always liked to work on problems alone because it helps me to focus better on the given task, so I have never learned how to work in a team properly. I feel that after having finished this project this will change and I will have learned how to be a great teammate and how to work in a team efficiently.

All in all, I believe that we have a great journey ahead of us and I hope I will have learned a lot at the end of this project.
