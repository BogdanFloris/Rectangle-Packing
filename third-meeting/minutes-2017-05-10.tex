	\section{Opening}
	
	The meeting opened at 15:39. We started earlier because the tutor notified us that he won't be coming today.
	
	\subsection{General remarks}
	
	Minutes and agenda from last week were uploaded. \\
	Self-reflections were uploaded. \\
	A basic algorithm was implemented and submitted as first-prototype.
	
	\section{Algorithm discussion}
	
	We have 4 different algorithms that we need to implement. \\
	First implementation should a brute-force one for no rotations no fixed height. \\
	Then an algorithm for fixed height should be implemented. \\
	These two should be adapted to work for rotations also. \\
	Then for a big number of rectangles, a greedy algorithm must be developed. \\
	Moreover, we have agreed that we need a way to generate test data and to visualize our input/output. \\
	Dragging and dropping rectangles would be nice. 
	
	\section{Project planning}
	
	\subsection{Work division}
	
	By next meeting, we have decided that: \\
	Bogdan and Sergiu should work on the basic algorithm for no rotations and no fixed height and if they have time they can look to start on other things. \\
	Jelle will look through all the research papers and gather all the information that we may need. \\ 
	Mike and Job will work on test data generation and visualization.
	
	\section{Google drive}
	
	Bogdan has been added to the drive folder. \\
	The tutor said that he would like to see the agendas and minutes on the drive so we have to add him too next meeting.
	
	\section{Final inquiry}
	
	We have a general idea about what should be implemented. We have delegated tasks for next week. \\
	Our next meeting is scheduled for the 10th of May. \\\\
	Meeting closed 16:13.
